// --- Variable Naming and Conventions --- //

//Variables must always be 1 word and cannot contain any spaces

let one = 1;
let word = "word";

//if a variable has several words try to use the camelcase convention

let thisIsOneWord = "One word";

//notice the first word is not capitalized but every word afterwards is.  This is CamelCase.  

//Camelcase example: thisIsCamelCaseSoUseThisKindOfNamingConvention

//The proper term to variable names is "Identifier"
//'thisIsOneWord' is an identifier for the String data "One word"

//Variable Identifiers can contain numbers BUT!!!! must always start with a letter

let 1one;

//^^^Notice the Red Squigglies which indicate that this name cannot be used as an identifier

let one1 = 11;

//^^^ Can be used as an identifier

//variable identifiers can also contain "$" "_" and any other digit BUT!!!! they cannot start with a digit

let _underscore = "_";

//^^^ This is acceptable

//This is another naming convention

let two_words = "word words";

//This is called Snake Casing

//USE CAMELCASE!!!!

//Try to make the Variable Identifier be a very very very short explanation of the data within

// Now if you were using some app to make of a cup of coffee and it asked

let option1 = "Hazlenut Coffee Creamer";
let option2 = "French Vanilla Coffee Creamer";

// "What type of creamer do you want?"
// 1. option1
// 2. option2

//What is 'option1' and what is 'option2'???

//look at the code below

let hazel = "Hazelnut Coffee Creamer";

let french = "French Vanilla Coffee Creamer"


// "What type of creamer do you want?"
// 1. hazel
// 2. french

//You would get a really good idea of what options 1 and 2 are

//Sometimes they cannot be this short sooo

//Out of the lineup who is the person you saw at the bank?

// 1. tallBaldMan
// 2. womanInYellow
// 3. securityGuard
// 4. businessManWithSuitcase

//These are a bit longer but very descriptive and each one can contain several different datatypes which will be covered in the future.  Just try to make the Variable Identifier Meaningful
